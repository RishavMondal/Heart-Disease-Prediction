# Heart Disease Prediction

This project explores the prediction of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through various steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, aiming to build an accurate predictive model.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction**  
   Overview of the project and the motivation for predicting heart disease.

2. **Dataset**  
   Description of the dataset, including its source and key attributes.  
   Example attributes: age, gender, cholesterol level, and more.

3. **Steps in the Analysis**  
   - **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of relationships between variables and target labels.  
   - **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting the most relevant features.  
   - **Model Building**: Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others.  
   - **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

4. **Results**  
   Summary of findings and the performance of the final model.

5. **Dependencies**  
   - Python (3.x)  
   - Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (ensure these are installed in your environment).

6. **Usage**  
   - Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Execute cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Future Work  
- Enhancing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
